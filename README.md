Have you grown weary of the flashy, functional, no-fuss typing websites?

Want to get your hands dirty and use a less-functional one, _for no apparent reason_?

## enter: **type-atron-5000**

It's the ~~seamless~~ seam-full typing experience that you've been waiting for.

- type-atron-5000 has no dependencies (that I'm aware of)

- yes, it is a shameless attempt to capture that sweet, sweet monkeytype lightning in a malformed bottleâ€”so what!!

**usage**: `npm install && nodemon server.js`

then, goto `http://localhost:3000/intex.html`

note, you may have to click around to find the 'input' area. still
heavily WIP!
