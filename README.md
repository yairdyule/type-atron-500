Have you grown weary of the flashy, functional, no-fuss typing websites? 

Want to get your hands dirty and use a less-functional one, *for no apparent reason*?

## enter: **type-atron-5000**

It's the ~~seamless~~ seam-full typing experience that you've been waiting for.

- type-atron-5000 has no dependencies (that I'm aware of)

- yes, it is a shameless attempt to capture that sweet, sweet monkeytype lightning in a malformed bottleâ€”so what!!

**usage**: `open index.html`
